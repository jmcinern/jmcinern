# My Portfolio
## V1 Bilingual Irish and English 8B parameter LLM that I developed.
- Continued  pre-training on an existing multilingual model on Irish language data. 
- Included high proportion of English data, as similar efforts reported degredation in English performance.
- Designed custom data scheduling for adaption efficiency, presenting the model with "easier" data first.
- Instruction tuned and optimized L1-speaker-aligned preference data to provide a user-friendly chatbot.
- Quantized with respect to most important parameters for English and Irish generation to reduce inference cost.
- The model is deployed: https://huggingface.co/spaces/jmcinern/Qomhra
