- Continued pre-training on an existing multilingual model on Irish language data. 
- Included high proportion of English data, as similar efforts reported degredation in English performance.
- Designed custom data scheduling for adaption efficiency, presenting the model with "easier" data first.
- Instruction tuned and optimized L1-speaker-aligned preference data to provide a user-friendly chatbot.
- Quantized with respect to most important parameters for English and Irish generation to reduce inference cost.
- The model is deployed: https://huggingface.co/spaces/jmcinern/Qomhra

- Created a semantic database, to allow an LLM to answer questions with the most relevant parliamentary contributions as context.
- Set up interface, using LangChain for few-shot prompting to ensure responses included direct quotes and debate citations.
- Deployment in the works.

- Collected a corpus of French-speaking African new media, covering 23 countries and over 50M words 
- Classified articles as to whether the subject was France.
- Measured the negative sentiment of these articles using multiple lexicons.
- Collected the CAC 40 market price for the same time period, calculated daily returns, acting as a proxy for the French stock market.
- Tested statisticsl assumptions of stationarity, heteroscedasticity and multi-colinearity, before performing parsimonious Vector Autogregressive (VAR) experiments.
- Measured the impact of negative sentiment on the stock market, identifying the significant relationship, that returns were positive when no negative sentiment detected.
